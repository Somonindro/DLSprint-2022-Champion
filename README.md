# DLSprint2022-Champion
Winning Solution of DLSprint2022, under the teamname -- *YellowKing* (*YKG*). The task was Automatic Speech Recognition on the Common Voices BN dataset. The model we used was wav2vec2.

## Description
Bengali is the fifth most spoken of all native languages all over the world. But so far very little work has been done on Bengali Speech Transcription. Considering the large audience and far-reaching opportunities, there’s significant business and educational interest in developing AI that can be used in 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐥𝐢 𝐀𝐒𝐑 (Automatic Speech Recognition). We, at the 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠, 𝐁𝐔𝐄𝐓, in partnership with 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐥𝐢.𝐀𝐈, are glad to present the very first Bengali ASR competition of its kind, 𝐃𝐋 𝐒𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐭, as a part of BUET CSE Fest 2022.

For training the model, we will be using a crowdsourced sentence-level automatic speech recognition corpus collected on the Mozilla Common Voice platform. The details of the dataset can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14053).
